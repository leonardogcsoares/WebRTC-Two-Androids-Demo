#To-Do
- [ ] Switch out `Button` for [FButton](https://github.com/hoang8f/android-flat-button), more aesthetically pleasing and might also solve call/hangup button disable issue.
- [ ] Implement `start` button that creates both the `PeerConnectionFactory` and `PeerConnection` instances.
- [ ] Fix callButton/hangupButton enable/disable logic.
- [ ] Implement onPause/onResume PeerConnection handling (connect/disconnect)
